// Write a function min that takes two arguments and returns their minimum.

/* Zero is even.  One is odd.  For any other number N, its evenness is the
 * same as N - 2.
 *
 * Define a recursive function isEven corresponding to this description. The
 * function should accept a single parameter (a positive, whole number) and
 * return a Boolean.
 *
 * Test it on 50 and 75. See how it behaves on -1. Why? Can you think of a
 * way to fix this?

/* Write a function countBs that takes a string as its only argument and
 * returns a number that indicates how many uppercase “B” characters there
 * are in the string.
 */

/* Next, write a function called countChar that behaves like countBs, except
 * it takes a second argument that indicates the character that is to be
 * counted (rather than counting only uppercase “B” characters).
 */ 

// Rewrite countBs to make use of this new function.
